# Human-Agent Teamwork for Search and Rescue
This is the repository for the Research Project 2023 (CSE3000) in TU Delft. The repository was forked from the [original repository](https://github.com/rsverhagen94/TUD-Collaborative-AI-2023) created for the interdependence and trust assignments of the course on Collaborative AI. It uses the [MATRX software package](https://matrx-software.com/) to create a simulated search and rescue task in a two-dimensional grid environment. The environment consists of multiple areas, injured victims, and obstacles blocking area entrances. One artificial agent (called RescueBot) and one human agent need to rescue these victims and deliver them to a drop off zone, while communicating and collaborating with each other.

## Task
The objective of the task is to find eight target victims in the different areas and carry them to the drop zone. Rescuing mildly injured victims (yellow color) adds three points to the total score, rescuing critically injured victims (red color) adds six points to the total score. The world terminates after successfully rescuing all target victims, or when the timelimit of 10 minutes has passed. The corresponding output logs will then be saved in the 'logs' folder. We created three interdependence conditions: baseline (full independence), complementary independence, opportunistic interdependence, required interdependence and mixed interdependence. Below we list the capabilities for each of these conditions.
#### Baseline (`baseline` branch)
- All victims can be carried by both human or RescueBot. 
- All obstacles (big rock, small stone, tree) can be removed by both human or RescueBot.
- The human and the RescueBot cannot make actions together.

#### Complementary (`complementary-independence` branch)
- Human can carry all victims, but they are unable to remove obstacles. 
- RescueBot can remove all obstacles, but it is unable to carry victims.
- The human and the RescueBot cannot make actions together.

#### Opportunistic (`opportunistic_interdependence` branch)
- Both human and RescueBot can carry all victims alone, but doing this together with human assistance is much faster.
- Both human and RescueBot can remove all obstacles alone, but doing this together with human assistance is much faster.

#### Required (`required-interdependence` branch)
- All victims can only be carried by both human and RescueBot together.
- All obstacles can only be removed by both human and RescueBot together.

#### Mixed (`mixed-interdependence` branch)
- Mildly injured victims can be carried by both human or RescueBot. 
- Only the human can carry critically injured victims.
- The big rock can only be removed by both human and RescueBot together.
- Both human and RescueBot can remove small stone, but doing this together with human assistance is much faster.
- The tree can only be removed by RescueBot.

## Installation
Download or clone this repository and the required dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. We recommend the use of Python 3.8 or 3.9, and to create a virtual environment for this project. You can use the following step by step installation steps after cloning or downloading this repository:
- Install the required dependencies through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. 
- Launch the human-agent teamwork task by running main.py.
- You will be asked to enter which task type to run: 
  - 'tutorial' will launch a step by step tutorial of the task in a simplified and smaller world, aimed at getting you familiar with the environment, controls, and messaging system. We highly recommend you to start with this tutorial.
  - 'official' will launch the complete task. Next, you will be asked to enter a name or id for the human agent that you will control. Finally, you will be asked to enter one of the human capability conditions 'normal', 'strong', or 'weak'. 
- Go to http://localhost:3000 and clear your old cache of the page by pressing 'ctrl' + 'F5'.
- Open the 'God' and human agent view. Start the task in the 'God' view with the play icon in the top right of the toolbar. The 'God' view is shown in the image above, cannot be used to control agents, and should only be used for debugging purposes. 
- Go to the human agent view to start the task. Open the messaging interface by pressing the chat box icon in the top right of the toolbar. You can now start playing the task.
## Overview
Below we discuss the content and files of the important folders in more detail. For the assignments, the only implemantation modifactions should be made to the 'agents1' and optionally the 'brains1' and 'worlds1' folders.
- 'actions1': Contains the 'CustomActions.py' file defining the various customized actions like 'CarryObjectTogether' and 'DropObjectTogether'.
- 'agents1': Contains the 'OfficialAgent.py' and 'TutorialAgent.py' files defining the behavior of the agents for the official and tutorial tasks. For the trust assigment, you will extend and modify the 'OfficialAgent.py'. More specifcally, you will extend the function '_trustBelief' and use the outputs of this function to adapt the agent's behavior defined by the function 'decide_on_actions'. 
- 'beliefs': Contains the 'currentTrustBelief.csv' and 'allTrustBeliefs.csv' files. These files are used for retrieving trust belief values when interacting with a human more than once, and used to save trust belief values for all the human agents that RescueBot collaborated with. 
- 'brains1': Contains the 'ArtificialBrain.py' and 'HumanBrain.py' files required to initialize RescueBot and the human agent. For the trust assignment, you might modify the human brain to create slower or faster humans, for example.
- 'loggers': Contains the 'ActionLogger.py' and 'OutputLogger.py' files. The action logger saves the actions and locations of both human and RescueBot during every tick of the task. In the MATRX world, all time is measured in ticks instead of seconds, and actions and messages are all executed at a single tick. The tick duration is set at 0.1, which means around 10 ticks are executed in a second. In addition, the output logger creates one output file and line with the time it took to finish the task (in ticks) and the total number of human and agent actions during the task. Finally, the output logger saves the trust belief values to the 'allTrustBeliefs.csv' file mentioned above. It is important to know that the output logger is only called when the task is successfully completed, or when you press the stop button in the 'God' view (the square button next to the play button). 
- 'worlds1': Contains the 'WorldBuilder.py' file defining the search and rescue environment and task. For the trust assignment, you might modify the world builder to add slower or faster humans, for example.
